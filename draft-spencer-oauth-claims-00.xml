                This document extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to include a
                simple query language that can be used by &c;s to request
                certain claims from an &as;. This mechanism can
                be used during the authorization request and refresh request. It
                also defines a response parameter of the token and introspection
                endpoints that indicates to the caller which claims were
                authorized by the &ro;. Lastly, it stipulates how this
                request parameter can be used during token exchange, and how
                &c;s may request that certain claims be placed in an access
                token intended for a particular &rs;.

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>
                As stated in Section 1.4 of <xref target="RFC6749"/>, an
                access token represents the specific scope and duration of
                access. The requested scope is verified by the &as;
                according to its policy, and the perhaps-different scope
                is granted by the &ro;. The requested and granted
                scope may vary due to the &as;'s policy and/or
                the &ro;'s limitation of the granted scope. The
                resulting scope is enforced by the &rs;. The way in
                which the &c; indicates the intended scope of access is by
                the <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> request parameter defined
                in Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6749"/>. This specification
                defines a more sophisticated instrument to achieve this same
                purpose.
            </t>

            <t>
                At times, this existing mechanism is too limited. In some uses
                cases, for example, a &c; may need to request particular
                claims from an &as;. It may also do this to
                request specific claim values. Furthermore, a &c; may need
                to indicate to the &as; that certain claims are
                essential for its ability to operate. In such cases, the grant
                is of little use to the &c; if the &ro; does not
                comply. Another example of when the existing
                <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter is insufficient is
                when the &c; knows that some claim is required by a
                particular &rs;. The extent of a &c;'s knowledge
                is usually limited to knowing that a claim is needed in an
                access token; however, in some cases, it may also know that a
                claim should be restricted to access tokens issued to a
                particular &rs;. In these situations, the existing
                mechanism for stipulating the scope of access is insufficient.
            </t>

            <t>
                To accommodate these use cases and requirements, this
                specification defines a new request parameter that can be used
                when the &c; obtains an authorization grant, as described in
                Section 1.3 of <xref target="RFC6749"/> and Section 2.1 of
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-token-exchange"/>. For each request
                wherein these fix grant types -- authorization code, implicit,
                resource owner password credentials, client credentials, and
                token exchange -- are sought, this specification defines a new
                parameter called <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx>. It can be
                used by a &c; with any of these to request that certain
                claims and/or particular claim values be authorized by the
                &ro;. The value of this parameter is a
                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object <xref target="RFC8259"
                />. This can also be used to indicate to the &as;
                that the &c; considers some or all of the claims to be
                required. The &c; can also use this object to indicate that
                certain claim values are preferred or essential to its ability
                to operate on behalf of the &ro;.
            </t>

            <t>
                During a refresh request (as described in Section 1.5 of
                <xref target="RFC6749"/>), the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx>
                parameter defined herein can also be used to alter the resulting
                scope of access. This can be used, for example, to lessen the
                scope by including a certain subset of claims that should be in
                the new access token. After such, a &c; may increase the
                scope in a subsequent refresh request by including additional
                claim names in the JSON object value of the <spanx style="verb">
                claims</spanx> authorization request parameter. When it does so,
                the &c; cannot, however, expand the scope from that which was
                initially authorized by the &ro;.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification also stipulates how the authorized claim
                names are returned from an authorization request and the result
                of introspecting a token.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification is designed to be compatible with OpenID
                Connect <xref target="OpenID.Core"/> but does not require the
                &as; to support that protocol.
            </t>

            <section title="Claims vis-a-vis Scope Tokens"
                     anchor="claims-vis-a-vis-scope-tokens">
                <t>
                    As previously stated, claims relate to scope tokens. How
                    exactly is beyond the extent of this specification. Instead,
                    this document provides a framework in which these two
                    constructs can be used together or independently. That said,
                    however, there are at least three common ways that claims
                    will be used:

                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t>Not at all (in which case this specification is
                            irrelevant).</t>
                        <t>In lieu of scope tokens.</t>
                        <t>Together with scope tokens.</t>
                    </list>

                    The first and second option are straightforward. The third,
                    however, will require a specification to define the
                    relation between the two in order to achieve
                    interoperability. For instance, <xref target="OpenID.Core">
                    OpenID Connect core</xref>
                    specification relates claims to scope tokens by grouping
                    certain claims into various scope tokens. This grouping of
                    claims into various scope tokens is RECOMMENDED when
                    simultaneously using claims and scope tokens to request
                    authorization.

                    As described in Section 1.5 of <xref target="RFC6749"/> and
                    further explained in section 6 thereof, a &c; that was
                    issued a refresh token MAY use this to narrow the scope of
                    access for an access token. It does this by sending the
                    <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> request parameter in step
                    (G) of Figure 2 of <xref target="RFC6749"/>. At times, the
                    &c; might want to be more explicit about which claims
                    should be included in the refreshed access token or about
                    where those claims should be asserted.
                </t>

                <t>
                    To address this need, this document defines an additional
                    input parameter that the &c; may send to the
                    &as; when it presents a refresh token to
                    the token endpoint. This update to the flow wherein a &c;
                    refreshes an access token to narrow the scope of access to
                    a particular set of claims is shown in
                    <xref target="refresh-token-flow"/>.

                    Downscoping in this flow is achieved when the &c;
                    requests a subset of the claims authorized by the &ro;.
                </t>

                <t>
                    The &c; MAY request to change the claims sink where the
                    authorized claims should be asserted using this flow. If the
                    &c; does so, it is RECOMMENDED that the &as;
                    accept this change baring any policy to the contrary.
                    The &c; MAY also send a claim value in the claim value
                    query object(s) of the request. When it does, the
                    &as; SHOULD consider this request when
                    asserting the claim but it MAY return an error if asserting
                    a different claim value is against its policy or exceeds the
                    authorization granted by the &ro;. If it is a
                    critical claim, the requested claim value MUST be asserted
                    or an error MUST result if the &as; supports
                    critical claims.

                <t>
                    There are many corner cases that can arise when implementing
                    this flow. Most stem from policy and configuration changes
                    of the &as; which may happen between the
                    time an access token is issued and it is refreshed. Other
                    complications arise when claims are used together with scope
                    tokens. Both are beyond the scope of this specification and
                    not addressed by this memo.

                The <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> request parameter value
                is a UTF-8 encoded JSON object ("Claims Request Object")
                specifying requested claims. Prior to transmission to the
                &as; it is also form-URL-encoded as appropriate.
                The claims request object is not intended to be a mechanism that
                the &c; may use to instruct the &as; to
                assert specific claims. Instead, it is a simple query language
                that a &c; can use to request certain claims or to specify
                that it would like the &as; to obtain
                authorization from the &ro; for a claim, perhaps with
                a particular claim value. The claims request object provides a
                &c; with a more structured method of requesting the scope of
                access that the &ro; authorizes it for.
            </t>
            <t>
                The top-level members of the claims request object SHOULD
                include at least one claims sink. The only specific claims sinks
                defined by this specification are
                <spanx style="verb">access_token</spanx>,
                <spanx style="verb">*</spanx>, and
                <spanx style="verb">?</spanx>. Additionally,
                this specification also sets forth a mechanism by which a &c;
                may signal to the &as; which claims it prefers
                to be included in an access token that it intends to be furnished to
                a particular &rs;; this is done by using an absolute
                URI of the target service or resource as a claims sink. A claims
                request object MAY also contain the member
                <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> to indicate parts of the
                claims request object that the &as; MUST
                understand if the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> member
                itself is understood. Other members of a claims request object
                MAY be present; any that are not understood by the &as;

                <t>
                    As described above, a &c; may also indicate that it
                    wishes the &as; to assert a claim having a
                    claim value that the &c; has some preference for. A

                    In this example, the &c; is requesting that the
                    &as; assert two essential claims: one named
                    <spanx style="verb">accountId</spanx> and another named
                    <spanx style="verb">paymentId</spanx>. In the former case,
                    the &c; requests that the claim value be
                    <spanx style="verb">act-123</spanx> or
                    <spanx style="verb">act-456</spanx>. In the later case, a
                    claim named <spanx style="verb">paymentId</spanx> is
                    requested by the &c; to have a claim value of
                    <spanx style="verb">pid-123456</spanx>. Again, the
                    &as; MUST NOT return an error if the
                    &ro; does not authorize both of these claims or
                    if they are non-existent. This is merely a request for a
                    certain scope of access.

                    In this example, the &c; is requesting (but not forcing)
                    the &as; to obtain authorization from the
                    &ro; for five essential claims:
                    <spanx style="verb">instructedAmount</spanx>,
                    <spanx style="verb">debtorAccount/iban</spanx>,

                    <spanx style="verb">creditorAccount/iban</spanx>, and
                    <spanx style="verb">remittanceInformationUnstructured</spanx>.
                    The claim value query object associated with each of these
                    claim names has a particular value the &c; strongly
                    prefers. One interesting case is the value of the
                    <spanx style="verb">instructedAmount</spanx> essential
                    claim; the query for the value of this claim is a JSON
                    object with two properties. The &as; might
                    use this claims request object to obtain the &ro;'s
                    consent before granting them, for instance. It
                    might also check these values against a data source before
                    asserting them. Based on the &ro;'s choice or the
                    data source lookup results, the &as; may
                    not issue the claims at all or may do so with some other
                    value. For example, the &as; may actually
                    find that the <spanx style="verb">instructedAmount</spanx>
                    value requested exceeds its policy's allowed limit and only
                    prompt the &ro; to authorize €100.

                    This example shows how a &c; may request claims defined
                    by the Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI)
                    Protocols for remote digital signature creation. Like the

                    includes a claim value query object for the

                    claims request object which the &as; MAY
                    understand.

                <t>
                    As described previously, the &c; can indicate to the
                    &as; that certain claims are preferential or
                    essential to the smooth operation of the &c;. At times,
                    however, the &c;'s needs are stronger and require certain
                    claims to be asserted. In such situations, the &c; would
                    rather the &as; return an error than grant
                    access with different claims than those requested. This is
                    not always possible for an &as;, however,
                    and a &c; MUST NOT assume that the &as;
                    can be controlled in this manner. To know if this
                    interaction pattern in supported, the &c; must have a
                    priori knowledge gained by some means not defined by this
                    specification or by the presence of a <spanx style="verb">
                    true</spanx> value in the &as;'s
                    <spanx style="verb">critical_claims_supported</spanx>
                    metadata (see section
                    <xref target="authorization-server-metadata"/> below). An
                    &as; is RECOMMENDED to support this
                    capability unless it cannot. When it does, the &as;
                    MUST issue any claim denoted as critical or it MUST
                    return an error. The error must be
                    <spanx style="verb">invalid_claims</spanx> as described below
                    in <xref target="obtaining-authorization"/>.
                </t>

                <t>
                    A &c; indicates to the &as; that it must
                    understand certain claims and be able to assert them by
                    including a list of JSON Pointers
                    <xref target="RFC6901"/>
                    associated with the <spanx style="verb">crit</spanx> member
                    of the claims request object. Each such claim that the
                    elements of this list point to is a "Critical Claim". The
                    JSON Pointers in this list MUST refer to members of the
                    claims request object and MUST NOT point to elements within
                    the list itself. If any JSON Pointer refers to an element of
                    the JSON Pointer list, the &as; MUST return
                    an error with a code of
                    <spanx style="verb">invalid_request</spanx> if it supports
                    critical claims. When the JSON Pointers are valid, if the
                    &as; does not understand any of the claims
                    pointed to by any of the elements of this list, the
                    &as; MUST return an error of
                    <spanx style="verb">invalid_claims</spanx>. Likewise, if
                    the &as; is unable to assert a critical
                    claim (and it supports critical claims), it MUST return the
                    same error. If a critical claim is requested with a certain
                    value (as in the following example), the &as;
                    MUST assert the claim with that exact claim value. If
                    it's not able to (e.g., because the &ro; does not
                    have an attribute with that particular value), the
                    &as; MUST return an error with a code of
                    <spanx style="verb">invalid_claims</spanx> unless it does
                    not support critical claims.

                    claims to be asserted in all claims sinks the &as;
                    supports. Rather than requiring the the &c; to
                    repeat its requirement for each claims sink, it MAY use the
                    special claims sink <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> (%x2A).
                    This claims sink indicates to the &as; that
                    the &c; prefers all claims included in the claims request
                    object to be asserted in each claim sink that the
                    &as; supports. The two claims request
                    objects shown in Figure
                    <xref target="example-all-claims-sink"/> and
                    <xref target="example-comparable-to-all-claims-sink"/>
                    are equivalent (if the &as; only supports
                    the two claims sinks shown in the latter).

                As stated in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6749"/>, a request
