# Contributing to the HAAPI Specification

In order to rapidly produce a specification of the Hypermedia Authentication API (HAAPI) originally created by Curity and to test various implementations of it for interoperability, different vendors have come together under the terms of the Open Web Foundation (OWF) Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to produce an open specification. The Work in Progress (WIP) can be found in this git repo. Anyone is able to contribute by:

* Sending a pull request with their signed CLA added to the `signed-agreements` directory.
* Adding their names to the authors section at the bottom of the applicable draft(s).
* Including their suggested changes.

The CLA that needs to be signed is [haapi-cla.pdf](haapi-cla.pdf). Signers (or their representatives) can open issues on GitHub to track open problems or pending work.

Any pull request containing text added to this directory of this git repo or any issue opened related to the contents of this directory will be considered a "Contribution" as defined in the CLA if included in the "Specification". The "Specification" is both:

* `draft-spencer-haapi-protocol.md`
* `draft-spencer-haapi-model.md`

(or similarly named files with alternative file extensions, e.g., `.xml`).

We're very happy that you are considering the idea of joining us in this work, and look forward to receiving your contributions!
